## Making Your Decision

**Consider:**
1. **Your target market** - local vs international
2. **Budget constraints** - initial and ongoing
3. **Growth plans** - expansion strategy
4. **Activity nature** - restrictions
5. **Personal preference** - location, lifestyle

## Hybrid Strategy
Some businesses benefit from both:
- Freezone for international operations
- Mainland branch for local sales
- Phased approach: Start in freezone, expand to mainland

## Conclusion
There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The right choice depends on your business model, target market, and financial capacity. Most startups benefit from freezone setup initially, then expand to mainland as they grow.
